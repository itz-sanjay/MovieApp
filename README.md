# MOVIE APP

## Project Description

## Conclusion

#####  To summarize, here’s what we did:
    
    - We got an API key for the OMDb API. 
    - We also built a component that lets a user search for a movie by title, 
      then stores the movie title in that component’s state. 
    - Next, we passed the function to the search form so it takes effect when we 
      click the button or hit enter. 
    - Then, we stored the response in the Movies state and built a search component 
      that displays the response data we got from the API. 
    - We then show the results to the user.
